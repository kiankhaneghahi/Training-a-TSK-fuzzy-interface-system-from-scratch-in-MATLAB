# Training a TSK fuzzy interface system from scratch in MATLAB

This project was the final project of my fuzzy control university course. This project is a library that trains a TSK fuzzy interface system (fis) from scratch in MATLAB and not using the MATLAB fis tools. The library was originally thought to be designed for every fuzzy system even other than TSK but it was reduced to just TSK because of the workload. Despite that, those parts exist in the functions and can be completed later. Also There are comments in the code that explain about the functions and how to use them.

The create_trained_fis.m file is function library that gives you the training parameters and rulebase and inputs based on different arguments to the function. The trained_fis_output.m file is also added to create the trained fis but it is incomplete even though it has many of the essential part of it, so feel free to use it and complete it if you want. In addition some tests that I performed on the library are given in the Tests folder.

Given the nature of programming in MATLAB, there is a performance issue with the library which makes it a little slow but it works fine. If you think that there is a better way to achieve the required performance then by all means do it.
