# Training a TSK fuzzy interface system from scratch in MATLAB

The create_trained_fis.m file is function library that gives you the training parameters and rulebase and inputs based on different arguments to the function. The trained_fis_output.m file is also added to create the trained fis but it is incomplete even though it has many of the essential part of it, so feel free to use it and complete it if you want.
